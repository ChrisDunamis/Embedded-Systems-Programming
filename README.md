> This is a typical breadboard and schematic representation for the project, designed with [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org).
>
> This is an open-source hardware initiative that makes electronics accessible as a creative material for anyone. We offer a software tool, a community website and services in the spirit of Processing and Arduino, fostering a creative ecosystem that allows users to document their prototypes, share them with others, teach electronics in a classroom, and layout and manufacture professional PCBs.

> __Simulation with Tinkercad:__  
> This project was designed and simulated on Tinkercad, which was part of my university project. Although I have not yet had the opportunity to recreate this in a real-life scenario, this will be a future prospect that I will continue someday.
>
> [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) is a free web app for 3D design, electronics, and coding. Weâ€™re the ideal introduction to Autodesk, a global leader in design and make technology.
